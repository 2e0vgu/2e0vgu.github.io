A 1/4 wave vertical antenna with elevated radials for 20m.

Overview

I made my very first contact with a VK station from England using one of these antenna. 100 watts and 5/5 both ways around 23:00Z. The next day, i built this antenna for myself from what I had to hand. I do a lot of portable work, so strived for simplicity and lightness. 

Diagrams and photos below. 

Component list

5m fishing rod pole
4 x 2m of guy rope
4 x tent pegs
SO239 chassis connector
Banana plug
2 x crocodle clips
Circle of rigid material (plasic, plywood, etc) that you can drill holes in
20m of wire for a 20m antenna. I use Sotabeams 1.5mm wire for the low weight. It handles 100 watt SAB no problem.



View from above. The mast is a 5m fishing rod style telescoping pole from Decathlon. FIXME: insert link. The mast fits through the middle of the wooden disc
and the hole is sized such that the disc rests about at the top of the lowest
 section of the mast.

The radials are used as guy wires to support the antenna - the end of the
radials are tied onto normal tent guying nylon and then pegged into the ground
with tent pegs. This tension supports the mast and keeps the radials nicely
elevated.
